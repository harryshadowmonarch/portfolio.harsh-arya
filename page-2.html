                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p><span id="profession">Hello! I'm Harsh Arya, a passionate
                        software web developer and a second-year B.Tech student
                        specializing in IoT and Cyber Security at CGC CEC
                        Landran, Mohali, with an expected graduation in 2027. My
                        journey in the tech world began with a fascination for
                        how interconnected devices shape our daily lives, and it
                        has since evolved into a deep commitment to building
                        secure and efficient web applications.

                        Throughout my academic career, I've honed my technical
                        skills in various programming languages and frameworks,
                        allowing me to create dynamic and user-friendly
                        websites. My projects reflect a blend of creativity and
                        technical proficiency, where I strive to implement the
                        latest technologies while ensuring optimal performance
                        and security.

                        In addition to my technical expertise, I pride myself on
                        my strong interpersonal skills and effective work
                        management. I believe that collaboration and
                        communication are key components of successful projects.
                        Whether working in teams or interacting with clients, I
                        focus on fostering positive relationships and ensuring
                        that everyone is aligned towards a common goal.

                        As I continue my studies, I am eager to take on new
                        challenges, expand my skill set, and contribute to
                        innovative projects that push the boundaries of
                        technology. I’m excited about the future of IoT and
                        Cyber Security and look forward to making a meaningful
                        impact in this ever-evolving field.

                        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see my work and get
                        in touch if you’d like to collaborate or discuss
                        ideas!</span>.</p>

                <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of coding and technology,
                    you can often find me indulging in my favorite hobbies that
                    bring me joy and balance in life.
                    <p>

                        Playing Guitar: Music has always been a significant part
                        of
                        my life, and playing the guitar allows me to express my
                        creativity and unwind. Whether I'm strumming along to my
                        favorite songs or experimenting with my own
                        compositions,
                        the guitar is my go-to outlet for relaxation and
                        inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Listening to Music: My love for music extends beyond
                        playing; I enjoy exploring various genres and
                        discovering
                        new artists. Music is a constant companion, whether I'm
                        studying, working on projects, or just taking a break.
                        It
                        fuels my creativity and helps me maintain a positive
                        mindset.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Football: As an avid football fan, I appreciate the
                        teamwork, strategy, and excitement that the game brings.
                        Whether I'm playing with friends or cheering for my
                        favorite
                        team, football keeps me active and engaged. It’s a
                        fantastic
                        way to bond with others, and I love the adrenaline rush
                        of a
                        close match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These hobbies not only provide me with a creative outlet
                        and
                        a way to stay active but also help me develop important
                        skills like discipline and teamwork that I apply in my
                        academic and professional pursuits. They remind me to
                        maintain a balanced lifestyle and keep my passion for
                        learning alive.</p>
